Source of data:
The tax on cigarettes data is from CDC website, cpi is from BLS website, and income and population by states is from BEA website.

In step 1, the 3 datasets have been merged into one data frame, and the columns has been renamed for later processing.
In addition, all the prices were adjusted by inflation using 2014 as base year.
(see attached codebook for detail)

In step 2, following steps has been done to analyze the data:

1. Graphically showed the inflation-adjusted price of cigarettes by state 1970–2014.

2. Graphically showed the average cigarette consumption by state 1970–2014.

3. Graphically showed the average cigarette consumption by year (across all states) 1970–2014.

4. Graphically showed the average price by year (across all states) 1970–2014.

5. Generated a scatterplot of consumption and inflation-adjusted prices.

6. Generated another scatterplot using log consumption and log prices.
